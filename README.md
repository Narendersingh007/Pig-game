#Pig Game üé≤
This is one of my first interactive web games built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The Pig Game is a simple two-player dice game where each player takes turns rolling a die to accumulate points.
	‚Ä¢	If a player rolls a 1, they lose their current round score and the turn passes.
	‚Ä¢	Players can ‚ÄúHold‚Äù to save their current score to the total.
	‚Ä¢	The first to reach 50 points wins the game.

It features:
	‚Ä¢	A fully responsive UI
	‚Ä¢	Dice animations using images
	‚Ä¢	Turn switching logic
	‚Ä¢	A modal popup for game rules on load
	‚Ä¢	Clean and beginner-friendly code structure

This project helped me practice DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic game logic in JavaScript.
