# 🎲 Pig Game

**Pig Game** is one of my first interactive web games built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s a two-player dice game where each player takes turns to roll the die and accumulate points.

## 🕹️ Game Rules
- If a player rolls a **1**, their **current round score is lost** and the turn switches to the other player.
- A player can **"Hold"** to save their current score and add it to their total.
- The first player to reach **50 points** **wins** the game.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Fully responsive user interface
- 🎲 Dice animations using images
- 🔁 Turn switching logic
- 💡 Modal popup with game instructions
- 🧠 Clean and beginner-friendly code structure

## 📚 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- DOM manipulation  
- JavaScript event handling  
- Game logic and state management  
- CSS styling and responsive layout
