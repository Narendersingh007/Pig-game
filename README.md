# 🎲 Pig Game

**Pig Game** is one of my first interactive web games built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It’s a two-player dice game where each player takes turns to roll the die and accumulate points.

## 🕹️ Game Rules
- 🎲 Each turn, a player rolls a dice as many times as they wish. Each result gets added to their current round score.
- ❌ If the player rolls a **1**, their **current score is lost**, and it becomes the next player's turn.
- 🛑 The player can choose to **"Hold"**, which means their **current score** is added to their **total score**.
- 🏆 The first player to reach **100 points** on the **total score** **wins** the game.

## ✨ Features
- ✅ Fully responsive UI  
- 🖼️ Dice images dynamically change based on rolls  
- 🔁 Real-time turn switching between two players  
- 💬 Modal popup with gameplay instructions  
- 📦 Clean file structure with images in `/images` folder  
- 🧠 Beginner-friendly and readable JavaScript code

## 📚 What I Learned
This project helped me strengthen my understanding of:
- ✅ DOM manipulation  
- ✅ JavaScript event-driven programming  
- ✅ Game state logic and score handling  
- ✅ CSS transitions and layouting
